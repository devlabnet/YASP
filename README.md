## YASP Application

Yet Another Serial Plotter: YASP is a combination of the standard “Arduino Serial Monitor” and the “Arduino Serial Plotter”.
You can either send and receive data via the monitor, the plotter part can receive data from
an Arduino, or any serial source, by parsing specially formatted messages. 

## Installation

All the source code for the plotter and for the “YASP” arduino library can be downloaded Here.
For those who don’t like to compile it, an installer is also downloadable [Windows Version](https://github.com/devlabnet/YASP/blob/master/installer/YASP_Setup.exe?raw=true).
Simple sketches example are also available under the “yasplib/example” subdirectory.
The easiest way to send data to the plots is using the provided [YASP Arduino Library](https://github.com/devlabnet/YASP/blob/master/installer/yaspLib.zip?raw=true).
In addition, Widgets capability, allows you to open simple “widget” like “Slider” or “Dial” to send data to the microcontroller via the Serial port.
